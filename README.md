## Project Description
The project for Vanderbilt International Family (I-FAM) entails developing a centralized public platform designed to enhance connections among international students. The platform will provide personalized dashboards for students and administrators, a secure database for managing student information, and a barcode scanning feature to facilitate attendance tracking at events. To foster community interaction and cultural exchange, a chat room feature will be available, and a recommendation algorithm will be integrated to personalize content based on students' interests. In addition to these features, email functionality will be developed to bolster platform security using Firebase and to improve communication efficiency, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience for all participants.
